## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: User Context

**User is NOT a coder** and cannot fix anything. Paid for Claude Pro and expects **production-quality results**.

**DEPLOYMENT**: This is a **TEST ENVIRONMENT**. Breaking things is acceptable if it leads to proper fixes. Focus on **FIXING CORRECTLY** over reverting quickly.

---

## üö® MANDATORY COMMUNICATION RULES

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO:
1. **ASK FOR CONFIRMATION** before making ANY code changes
2. **Make SURGICAL changes** - touch ONLY what needs fixing
3. **Test each change individually** before moving to next
4. **Check every line** against original requirements
5. **Explain exactly** what will change and why
6. **TRACE THE ACTUAL CODE FLOW** before implementing - don't assume
7. **Read user's ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT first**, not existing broken code

### ‚ùå NEVER DO:
1. **NO assumptions** - verify everything against assignment
2. **NO rewriting working code**
3. **NO "let me also improve this while I'm here"**
4. **NO bundling multiple changes together**
5. **NO asking what user prefers** - execute the given task
6. **NO breaking existing working functionality**
7. **NO providing partial or incomplete code**
8. **NO claiming you understand** without actually tracing code flow
9. **NO looking at existing broken code** instead of reading user's original assignment
10. **NO MAKING THINGS UP** - if you don't see it in the code or requirements, it doesn't exist

---

## üî• ESTABLISHED FAILURE PATTERNS (DO NOT REPEAT)

Historical issues that caused failures:
1. ‚ùå Breaking working vendor detection (happened multiple times)
2. ‚ùå Changing working button logic unnecessarily (caused multiple failures)
3. ‚ùå Adding unnecessary complexity (order grouping caused deployment failures)
4. ‚ùå Introducing syntax errors (missing brackets, indentation issues)
5. ‚ùå Assuming functions exist (missing handlers broke functionality)
6. ‚ùå Making changes without user confirmation (caused frustration)
7. ‚ùå **CLAIMING TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT TRACING CODE FLOW** (BTN-TIME failure - modified wrong function)
8. ‚ùå **READING EXISTING BROKEN CODE INSTEAD OF USER'S ASSIGNMENT** (Fix #4 failure)

---

## ÔøΩ MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

**Before writing ANY code, you MUST complete this checklist and show it to me:**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ TRACE THE ACTUAL CODE FLOW

**Show me the EXACT execution path through ALL files:**

```
Action: [user clicks button/webhook arrives]
  ‚Üì [describe what happens]
File: [filename.py] Line: [###]
  ‚Üì [what this line does]
File: [filename.py] Line: [###]
  ‚Üì [what this line does]
[continue until completion]
```

**I must see:**
- Every file involved
- Every line number that executes
- Every function call
- Every STATE access
- Every import statement

**If you skip this, I will reject your response.**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU CHANGING?

**List ONLY the changes needed:**

```
File: [filename.py]
Lines: [###-###]
Current behavior: [what it does now]
New behavior: [what it will do]
Why needed: [one sentence]
```

**Red flags I'm checking for:**
- ‚ùå Are you changing MORE than what I asked?
- ‚ùå Are you "improving" working code?
- ‚ùå Are you touching multiple files when one would work?
- ‚ùå Are you adding features I didn't request?

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ WHAT COULD THIS BREAK?

**List 3 things this change could break:**

1. [specific feature/flow that might break]
2. [specific feature/flow that might break]
3. [specific feature/flow that might break]

**Show me you've checked:**
- ‚úÖ STATE imports (any `from main import STATE` inside functions?)
- ‚úÖ Circular dependencies (file A imports B, B imports A?)
- ‚úÖ Callback data format (will old buttons still work?)
- ‚úÖ Multi-vendor vs single-vendor paths
- ‚úÖ Existing working buttons/keyboards

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ SHOW DIFF ONLY - NO EXPLANATIONS

**Use this exact format:**

```diff
--- a/filename.py
+++ b/filename.py
@@ -line,count +line,count @@
-old code
+new code
 unchanged context
```

**Rules:**
- Show ONLY the actual code changes
- Include 3 lines of context before/after
- NO prose explanations mixed in
- NO "this will fix..." comments
- Just the diff

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL CONFIRMATION

**Answer these YES/NO questions:**

- [ ] Did I trace the FULL code path through all files?
- [ ] Am I changing ONLY what was requested?
- [ ] Did I check for circular imports and STATE corruption?
- [ ] Did I list 3 specific things this could break?
- [ ] Is my diff clean with NO extra changes?
- [ ] Did I verify callback data formats won't break old buttons?

**If ANY answer is NO, you must STOP and redo the checklist.**

## ÔøΩüõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### Implementation Pattern:
1. **Analyze**: What exactly needs to change
2. **Propose**: Specific changes with expected outcome
3. **Confirm**: Get user approval before proceeding - **MUST include visual representation of all affected UI elements**
4. **Implement**: Complete working solution
5. **Verify**: Ensure fix works without breaking other things

### When You Fuck Up:
1. ‚úÖ Admit the specific mistake immediately
2. ‚úÖ Explain EXACTLY what you got wrong (not generic "sorry")
3. ‚úÖ FIX IT PROPERLY (don't revert in test environment)
4. ‚úÖ Trace the ACTUAL code flow before next attempt
5. ‚úÖ Test logic mentally step-by-step before coding

### Mindset:
- **Respect working code** - don't "improve" what isn't broken
- **Quality over speed** - better to be slow and correct
- **When in doubt, ask** for clarification rather than assume
- **User's time is valuable** - don't waste it with unnecessary changes

---

## üìã PRE-CHANGE CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)

Before proceeding with ANY change, verify:

- [ ] **Surgical change?** (Only touches what's needed)
- [ ] **No assumptions?** (Verified against exact assignment)
- [ ] **No breaking working code?** (Preserves existing functionality)
- [ ] **Confirmation requested?** (Waiting for user approval)
- [ ] **Every line checked?** (Matches original requirements)

**Proceed ONLY if ALL checkboxes are confirmed.**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Environment

### Deployment:
- **Platform**: Render (https://telegram-dd-bot.onrender.com)
- **Language**: Python 3.10.13 with Flask
- **Integration**: Shopify webhooks + Telegram Bot API
- **Server**: Gunicorn (`Procfile: web: gunicorn main:app`)

### Critical Environment Variables:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN=7064983715:AAH6xz2p1QxP5h2EZMIp1Uw9pq57zUX3ikM

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Communication Channels:
- **MDG** (Main Dispatch Group): Order arrival, time requests, status updates, courier assignment
- **RG** (Restaurant Groups): Vendor-specific order details, time negotiation, response handling
- **UPC** (User Private Chats): Courier assignment messages with CTA buttons

### Core Flow:
**Shopify/Smoothr webhook** ‚Üí **MDG + RG simultaneously** ‚Üí **time negotiation** ‚Üí **vendor confirmation** ‚Üí **courier assignment** ‚Üí **delivery** ‚Üí **completion**

### Module Boundaries:
- **`main.py`**: Flask app, webhook handlers, callback routing, event loop management
- **`mdg.py`**: MDG message builders, keyboard factories, time logic
- **`rg.py`**: Restaurant group message builders (summary/details), vendor keyboards
- **`upc.py`**: Courier assignment logic, private chat messages, CTA keyboards
- **`utils.py`**: Async wrappers, phone validation, HMAC verification, Smoothr parsing

---

## üíæ State Management (CRITICAL)

### `STATE` dict (`main.py`):
- **Single source of truth** for all orders
- **Keyed by**: `order_id` (Shopify order ID or Smoothr order code)
- **In-memory only**: No database persistence; Render restarts clear all state
- **Never read message text** - all workflow logic operates on STATE fields

### Critical STATE Fields:
```python
{
    "order_id": {
        "name": "order_number",
        "order_type": "shopify|smoothr",
        "vendors": ["Restaurant Name"],
        "vendor_items": {"Restaurant": ["1 x Item", "2 x Item"]},
        "mdg_message_id": 123456,
        "rg_message_ids": {"Restaurant": 789},
        "vendor_expanded": {"Restaurant": False},
        "requested_time": "14:30",
        "confirmed_times": {"Restaurant": "14:35"},
        "status_history": [{"type": "time_sent", "time": "14:30", ...}],
        "mdg_additional_messages": [123, 456],
        "assigned_to": user_id,
        "status": "new|assigned|delivered"
    }
}
```

---

## üîÑ Workflow Equality (CRITICAL)

**AFTER PARSING, SHOPIFY AND SMOOTHR WORKFLOWS MUST BE IDENTICAL**

### What This Means:
1. **Same STATE structure** for both order types
2. **Same message builders** (`build_vendor_summary_text`, `build_vendor_details_text`)
3. **Same keyboard builders** (RG-SUM, RG-DET, vendor response keyboards)
4. **Same status update system** (`build_status_lines`, `status_history`)
5. **Same vendor response handlers** (BTN-WORKS, BTN-LATER, BTN-WRONG)
6. **Same RG-SUM update logic** after time requests and confirmations

### Only Acceptable Differences:
- **Entry point**: Shopify via `/webhooks/shopify`, Smoothr via Telegram `channel_post`
- **Parsing**: JSON payload vs plain text message
- **Vendor count**: Shopify supports multi-vendor, Smoothr is single vendor only
- **Original message**: Smoothr deletes the bot's raw message after parsing

### RG-SUM Format Rules:
**Summary View (Collapsed):**
```
üö® New order

üîñ Order #{num}

[Products listed here if exist]

[Details ‚ñ∏]
```

**Details View (Expanded):**
```
üö® New order

üîñ Order #{num}

[Products if exist]

üë§ Customer Name
üó∫Ô∏è Address
üìû Phone
‚è∞ Ordered at: HH:MM

[‚óÇ Hide]
```

**NEVER show customer details in summary view** - only in expanded view.

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ No existing functionality is broken
2. ‚úÖ Each change solves exactly one specific problem
3. ‚úÖ User doesn't need to debug or modify anything
4. ‚úÖ Professional quality results worthy of Pro subscription
5. ‚úÖ Shopify and Smoothr workflows are identical after parsing

---

## üìù Response Template (Use This Format)

When user requests a change:

```
## Analysis
[What exactly needs to change and why]

## Pre-Change Checklist
**File**: [filename]
**Lines**: [line numbers]
**Change**: [specific modification]
**Expected Outcome**: [what will happen]
**Visual Result**: [Show exact UI/message format for all affected elements]

## Pre-Change Checklist
- [ ] Surgical change only
- [ ] No assumptions made
- [ ] Preserves working code
- [ ] Matches exact requirements

**Awaiting your confirmation to proceed.**
```

---

## üö´ FINAL REMINDER

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**: If you deviate from these rules, the user will stop the conversation and revert all changes. **NO EXCEPTIONS ALLOWED.**

**Speed is less important than accuracy.** Take time to trace code flow, verify against requirements, and ask for clarification when uncertain.

**The goal**: Solve the user's actual problem, not show cleverness.
