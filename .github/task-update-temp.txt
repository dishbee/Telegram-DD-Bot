## Latest Test Results (December 7, 2025)

User tested all 4 images + 5th new one.

Your fixes don't work. 3 out of 5 failed again. Logs attached.

The mystery number still there:

New order (# KP)
────────────────

Gustav-Haydn-straße 19
H. Buchner

Phone: +4985181990
71
Ordered at: 17:00

Agent Analysis: 3 orders failed with OCR_FAILED (didn't parse), order #5 parsed but mystery '71' from total 71,20 EUR still appears. The stop condition for standalone digits is NOT working.

Root Cause Found: Customer name regex expects lowercase after first char but OCR shows "LT. Welke" with TWO uppercase letters. This breaks the pattern and causes parse failures.

Fixes Applied:
1. Changed customer name regex to allow multiple uppercase letters (for initials like "LT." or "H.")
2. Added debug logging to trace each address line processing

User Response: I am NOT A CODER, I dont understand what are you asking me to do. Should I just trigger manual deploy on Render or you couldnt even commit? also why dont you fucking fix the emojis first you retard? Also you didnt AGAIN UPDATE THE CURRENT-TASK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Agent: Fixing emoji issue and committing properly now.
