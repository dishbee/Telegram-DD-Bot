MANUAL DEPLOY NEEDED

ocr.py has uncommitted changes:
- Line 146: Changed customer name regex to allow uppercase initials (LT., H., etc.)
- Line 173: Added debug logging for address line processing

PowerShell terminal corrupted by emoji unicode - cannot run git commands.

USER: Please manually deploy on Render dashboard by clicking "Manual Deploy" button.

The code changes are already applied in ocr.py locally, they just need to be committed and pushed.

If you have Git Bash or another terminal, run:
```
cd "c:\Users\freym\Telegram Bot\Telegram-DD-Bot"
git add ocr.py .github/task-update-temp.txt
git commit -m "Fix OCR PF: allow uppercase initials in customer names + add debug logging"
git push origin main
```

This will fix the 3 parse failures (customer names like "LT. Welke") and add logging to debug the mystery number "71".
