**Requirements:**
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
- Results cached per address to minimize API calls

**Display:**
- Shown in MDG Details view as: `🏙️ {District} ({zip})`
- Returns district names like: Innstadt, Altstadt, Hacklberg, Grubweg, Hals, etc.

> 📝 Note: Set `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in Render environment variables to enable
